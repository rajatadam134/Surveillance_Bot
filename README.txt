The Hardware folder contains the Rough Circuit Diagram, Components Required, their Connections, etc

I'd like you to please build the Bot accordingly.

Now, coming to the software part,
- Set up the Raspberry Pi
- Install all the required Libraries, the MJPG file according to the file
- Install the mobile application
- Run the Code on the Raspberry PI
- You have to train your ML model. I have used the Teachable Machine website to train the model. 
- I have provided you with a small Dataset of Fire Images, which can work on small-scale  projects
- You can train your model for fire or face detection, or any model you want
- I have provided a Jupyter file in the ML_savedmodel folder You can use that by copying it to where the model you have trained is stored (THIS FILE IS ONLY FOR FIRE DETECTION)
